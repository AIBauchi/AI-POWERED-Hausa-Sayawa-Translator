# AI-POWERED Hausa Sayawa Translator

## Project Overview

The AI-POWERED Hausa Sayawa Translator project aims to develop an advanced language translation system capable of translating text from English to Hausa, English to Sayawa, and Hausa to Sayawa using state-of-the-art AI models.

## Project Phases

### 1. Phase 1: English to Hausa Translator

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather diverse English-to-Hausa parallel sentence data.
   - Checkpoint 1: Report dataset size and diversity.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and tokenize the data.
   - Checkpoint 2: Share preprocessing details.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose a suitable machine translation model.
   - Checkpoint 3: Present selected model and rationale.

4. **Training:**
   - Train the model on the dataset.
   - Checkpoint 4: Provide training progress and challenges.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess model accuracy using metrics.
   - Checkpoint 5: Report evaluation results and improvements.

### 2. Phase 2: English to Sayawa Translator

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather diverse English-to-Sayawa parallel sentence data.
   - Checkpoint 6: Report dataset size and diversity.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Apply preprocessing steps similar to Phase 1.
   - Checkpoint 7: Share preprocessing details.

3. **Model Adaptation:**
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the Sayawa dataset.
   - Checkpoint 8: Provide progress and challenges.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess model performance using metrics.
   - Checkpoint 9: Report evaluation results and improvements.

### 3. Phase 3: Hausa to Sayawa Translator

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather substantial Hausa-to-Sayawa parallel sentence data.
   - Checkpoint 10: Report dataset size and diversity.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Apply preprocessing steps specific to the Hausa language.
   - Checkpoint 11: Share preprocessing details.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train a new model or adapt existing models.
   - Checkpoint 12: Provide progress and challenges.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess model accuracy and fluency.
   - Checkpoint 13: Report evaluation results and improvements.

### 4. Final Phase: Integration and Deployment

1. **Integration:**
   - Combine the English-to-Hausa and Hausa-to-Sayawa models.
   - Checkpoint 14: Report progress and integration challenges.

2. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test the integrated system.
   - Checkpoint 15: Share testing results and bug fixes.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Optimize models for deployment.
   - Checkpoint 16: Provide details on optimization efforts.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the integrated system with all translation models.
   - Checkpoint 17: Report successful deployment and any issues.
